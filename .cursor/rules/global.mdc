# Superfaktura Project Basics

## Project Purpose

- This repo is a Node.js TypeScript package named `superfaktura-library`.
- It provides both:
  - an importable SDK for SuperFaktura API
  - a CLI tool `superfaktura`
- Current feature scope: contacts + invoices, including invoice PDF download.

## API and Domain Conventions

- Public naming uses `contacts`, but API endpoints map to SuperFaktura `clients/*`.
- Auth module value is hardcoded to `superfaktura-library`.
- Default API URL is sandbox (`https://sandbox.superfaktura.sk`) unless overridden.
- Do not add rate-limit data to public SDK output unless explicitly requested.

## Build and Runtime Conventions

- Keep setup minimal and modern:
  - ESM-only package
  - Node `>=22`
- Keep CLI IDs positional for commands that require ID input.

## Coding Style

- Prefer simple, boring implementations over abstractions.
- Keep configuration and scripts minimal.
- Use dash-case filenames.
- Keep text mode and JSON mode behavior stable unless user asks to change.
- Prefer manual verification flows in this repo unless tests are explicitly requested.
